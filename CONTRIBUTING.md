# How to contribute

## Development

1. Clone and setup the repo into your local environment (see "Getting Started" in the [main readme](README.md#getting-started))
2. Create a new development branch (use a unique and descriptive name in *kebab-case*, see [naming conventions](https://namingconvention.org/git/branch-naming.html))
3. Make the appropriate edits and additions in your new branch
4. Submit a pull request with a detailed description of the changes that were made. Read up on [submitting pull requests](#submitting-pull-requests)
5. Deployment should only be done after a merge to the `main` branch and appropriate testing
6. If applicable, indicate that the corresponding issue has been solved, and [close the issue](#closing-issues)

### Coding Conventions

Follow the normal [Python style guides](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) as well as the **code styles** outlined in the [main readme](README.md#code-style)

## Submitting Pull Requests

1. Create a pull request from your development branch into the `main` branch
2. Request one of the [moderators](#repository-moderators) to review the pull request
3. Wait for an approval, or address any requested changes
4. After an approval, squash and merge the pull request
5. If a deployment is needed, do so.
